// There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
// You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

// Each child must have atleast one candy.
// Children with a higher rating than it's neighbours get more candies than neighbors.
// Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

// Example 1:

// Input:
// N = 3
// ratings = [1, 0, 2]
// Output:
// 5
// Explanation:
// You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
// Example 2:

// Input:
// N = 3
// ratings = [1, 2, 2]
// Output:
// 4
// Explanation:
// You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
// The third child gets 1 candy because it statisfies the above two conditions.
// Your Task:
// You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minCandy() which takes the interger N and integer array ratings as parameters and returns the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
// 0 ≤ ratingsi ≤ 109
