// Given an array arr integers. Do the following operation until a single element is left. For every kth operation:

// Right, rotate the vector clockwise by 1.
// Delete the (n â€“ k + 1)th element
// Now, Return the element that is left in the end.

// Examples:

// Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Rotate the array clockwise i.e. after rotation the array A = {6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and delete the last element that is {5} that will be A = {6, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Again rotate the array for the second time and deletes the second last element that is {2} that will be A = {4, 6, 1, 3}, doing similar operation when we perform 4th operation, 4th last element does not exist. Then we deletes 1st element ie {1} that will be A = {3, 6}. So, continuing this procedure the last element in A is {3}. So, the output will be 3.
// Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Rotate the vector clockwise i.e. after rotation the vector arr = [4, 1, 2, 3] and delete the last element that is 3 that will be arr = [4, 1, 2]. After doing all the operations, the output will be 2.
// Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.size() <= 105
// 1 <= arr[i] <= 106

            arr.insert(arr.begin(), ele);
            arr.pop_back();
            int n = arr.size();
            if (i < n)
                arr.erase(arr.begin() + n - i);
            else
                arr.erase(arr.begin());
            if (arr.size() == 1)
                break;
            i++;
        }
        return arr[0];
    }
