// As the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve, Geek bid farewell to the wasted moments of 2023, realizing the untapped potential of GFG's Problem of the Day.

// His 2024 resolution: Solve POTD every day.

// Eager to earn coins for GFG Merchandise, Geek faces new rules:

// Earning Coin: Geek can accumulate coins[i] by solving the POTD on the ith day, where 1 <= coins[i] <= 2024 and the sum of coins <= 2024.
// Merchandise Eligibility: To purchase merchandise, the coins earned must be divisible by 20 or 24, or precisely equal to 2024.
// Geek's resolutions often fades over time. Realistically, he can only commit to active participation for N (where N â‰¤ 366) days. Given the value of N and number of coins associated with each POTD, can Geek strategically solve some (or all) POTDs to become eligible for redeeming merchandise?

// Example 1:

// Input:
// N = 8
// coins = [5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 2, 3, 5]

// Output: 1

// Explanation:
// Geek can fulfill the criteria in many ways.
// One such way is to solve POTD on 4th and 5th day.
// Another way is to solve POTD on 1st, 4th and 8th day.
// Example 2:

// Input:
// N = 5
// coins = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Output: 0

// Explanation: There is no way Geek can become eligible.
// Your Task:
// You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isPossible() which takes n and coins[ ] as input parameters and returns a boolean value.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(N*(Sum of coins))
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*(Sum of coins))

// Constraints:
// 1 <= N <= 366
// 1 <= coins[i] <= 2024
// 1 <= Sum of coins <=  2024

                {

                }
            }
