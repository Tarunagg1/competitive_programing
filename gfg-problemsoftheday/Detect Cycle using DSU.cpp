// Given an undirected graph with no self loops with V (from 0 to V-1) nodes and E edges, the task is to check if there is any cycle in the undirected graph.

// Note: Solve the problem using disjoint set union (DSU).

// Example 1:

// Input: 

// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is a cycle between 0->2->4->0
// Example 2:

// Input: 

// Output: 0
// Explanation: The graph doesn't contain any cycle
// Your Task:
// You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function detectCycle() which takes number of vertices in the graph denoting as V and adjacency list adj and returns 1 if graph contains any cycle otherwise returns 0.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
// Expected Space Complexity: O(V)

// Constraints:
// 2 ≤ V ≤ 104
// 1 ≤ E ≤ 104
